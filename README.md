# Football Stock Recommendation System
Repository for Semester A 2024 ISYS2101 - Software Engineering Project Management

## 📖 Description
English football became the most popular sport for hundreds of years and attracted billions of spectators since then. This enthusiasm goes beyond the field, as there is an increasing desire to contribute to the beloved clubs' success. But figuring out how to navigate the sports investment market can be challenging. Traditional financial analysis frequently ignores aspects particular to sports teams, like player performance and fan involvement. This is where the Football Stock Recommendation System (FSRS) steps in. The goal of FSRS is to provide prospective investors and football fans with the knowledge and resources necessary to make wise investment choices involving Premier League teams. We close the knowledge gap by offering a data-driven platform designed with the football industry in mind.
